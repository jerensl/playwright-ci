<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Running Playwright tests in CI/CD can be challenging when it comes to reporting, logs, and debugging. This library aims to:
✅ Streamline test reports for better visibility.
✅ Seamlessly integrate with GitHub Actions.
✅ Enhance debugging with structured logs.

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
